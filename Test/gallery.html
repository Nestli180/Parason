        <p>Another problem with YouTube is the large amount of content that violates the rights of rights holders to reproduce and copy material . Despite US law disclaiming responsibility for user-uploaded material and YouTube's assurance that all material
            posted in violation of the law was immediately removed from the site, several lawsuits were filed against the company by the fall of 2006. In particular, in September, representatives of the music label Universal Music announced their intention
            to sue on YouTube . At the time, many experts were predicting the fate of the popular Napster audio hosting site , which was shut down in 2000 due to claims by rights holders. [24] [25][13] . YouTube has made significant efforts to resolve
            copyright disputes. In September 2006,an agreement was signedbetween YouTube and Warner Music under which the servicewas allowed to publish material owned by Warner Musicin exchange for a portion of advertising revenue. In October of that
            year, similar agreements signed with Universal Music, as well as other major labels Sony BMG Music Entertainment and media company CBS [26] [27] . YouTube later signed cooperation agreements with other media giants, such as Time Warner Inc.
            and The Walt Disney Company [28] [29]. Now, in the case of substantiated claims, videos posted by users who do not have the copyright are removed from the site. In November 2006 , was completed purchase of YouTube by Google for 1.65 billion
            dollars [30] . The deal was Google Inc.'s biggest purchase. throughout the history of the company [31] [13] [21] . Before buying YouTube from Google, there was a similar service - Google Video . Google does not intend to close it, but will
            use it as a place to search for videos on all sites where you can post videos. Google Video Search now includes YouTube. Despite the fact that YouTube is the third most popular site in the world, it is not possible to make money on it, as
            Google CEO Eric Schmidt has repeatedly stated . Advertising does not bring the revenue that Google initially expected, and site maintenance is quite expensive. According to the analytical agency comScore, the cost of supporting YouTube in
            2009 was $ 740 million; this is twice as much as the portal managed to earn. Google has long been trying to come up with new models that would allow the video service to make money. In 2008, the search engine agreed with Apple and Amazon to
            sell music through YouTube. In addition, Google is actively contracting withmedia holdings that post fragments of movies, TV series and TV shows on YouTube .</p>
