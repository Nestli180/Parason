                <p>Publications in journals such as Nature or Science are extremely prestigious, because the articles published in these journals are often cited, and the author is gaining wide popularity outside his field of science. Thus, the impact factor
                    Nature in 2009 was equal to 34.48, ie each article in the two years that have passed since its publication, on average, is cited more than 34 times. The selection criteria for articles in Nature (as well as in Science ) are extremely
                    strict. A large number of articles are eliminated before the peer review stage, because the results of the research described in the article proposed for publication in Nature should represent a very significant advancement in a particular
                    field of science.</p>

                <p>Established on 14 February 2005 in the US city of San Bruno , California designer Chad Hurley ( Eng. Chad Hurley ) and programmers Steve Chen ( Eng. Steve Chen ) and Jawed Karim ( Eng. Jawed Karim ), who previously worked together in the
                    company of PayPal [9] [10] [11] . According to one version, the author of the idea of ​​the project was Karim, who was inspired to create the service by his own unsuccessful attempts to find a video on the Internet with Janet Jackson
                    andJustin Timberlake [11] [12] . According to another version, the idea of ​​creating YouTube arose when Hurley, Chen and Karim wanted to share photos and videos taken during the party, and it turned out that the Internet does not
                    have a convenient service for posting videos [9] [13] . It was then decided to create a site where users could easily upload short videos, which were then automatically recoded into flash video format , which would allow them to view
                    videos in most Internet browsers [14] . The first video lasting 19 seconds under the title "I am Zoo" appeared online April 23, 2005 [9] [10] [15] . It was hosted by one of the company's founders, Javed Karim . Initially, the service
                    was not popular, but in July 2005, after the introduction of a number of innovations, including the ability to leave comments on videos and insert videos from YouTube in posts on other sites, blogs, the number of site visitors began
                    to grow rapidly. In December 2005, the number of daily hits has amounted to 8 million, and by July 2006 their number increased to 100 million, which, according to YouTube, constituted 60% of all views online videos on the Internet
                    [16] [10] [17] . The site used Flash Video (FLV) technology , which allows you to get good recording quality with a small amount of transmitted data. The project has become a good means of entertainment and, having formed its community,
                    according to statistics from the analytical company Alexa , is ahead of the social network MySpace in popularity . Sequoia Capital was the first major investor in YouTube ; from November 2005 to April 2006, it has invested in the project
                    is 11.5 million dollars [18] [19] . According to some reports, another 25 million investment service managed to attract in April 2006 [20] . In March of the same year, the site began to display contextual advertising, however, according
                    to experts, during the first years of its existence, the service did not bring any income to its owners. One of the main reasons for this called the high cost of support YouTube: only Internet traffic, according to April 2006, costing
                    him $ 1 million a month [21] [22] [23] .</p>
